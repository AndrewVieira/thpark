Team Information - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17_FFCro4WTE8n7NICMeMUmBagxfW4iWU0G2M5F5uiqU/edit

## Things to Do
- Rename to thpark until we find a name
- Research - project topic, tools we might use (frontend, backend, databases), Github and Git, asthetic design
- Requirements (due Feb. 18th) - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TJcsjRqCJuuR4YRm3Q-0Q3vTW1bsBURwJpG5dSwuCvI/edit?usp=sharing
- Schema (due Feb. 18th) - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EXaurxZ3R2g3FaYmWZr2iskbevvRyzDn/view?usp=sharing

## Some Front End Resources
For front end, a general knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript is useful (no need to memorize every term, use a cheet sheet!)
If you know C++, Java, or Python, Javascript should be very easy to learn as it is simple and forgiving

### Some other things to may want to look at:
- Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/, helps organize html and css elements
- ReactJS https://reactjs.org/, Here is a small project I made with ReactJs if you want to see what the code might look like: https://github.com/AndrewVieira/web-calculator

### Some Resources that we may use:
- w3schools https://www.w3schools.com/, Has tutorials and references for html, css, javascript, and much more. I use this a lot!
- Mozilla Firefox Devloper https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/, Another website that has tutorials and references
- CSS Tricks https://css-tricks.com/, shows you how to do some cool effects and design with CSS
- Google Fonts https://fonts.google.com/
- Paletton https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF, Are you bad at choosing colors like me? This website might help (or not lol)
- Stock Images, Templates, Photos, Music: There are free resources online for these things but be very careful using these because of copyright! Try using original material so we have less to worry about legal wise.

## Some Backend and Databases to Consider
### Backends
- Java, C/C++ - There's no specific backends, you just use the language and an interface to connect with dbms
- Python: Django https://www.djangoproject.com/, Flask https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/
- Javascript: NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/, ExpressJS (used with NodeJS) https://expressjs.com/

### Database Management Systems (Free Ones)
- PostgreSQL https://www.postgresql.org/
- MySQL https://www.mysql.com/
- Microsfot SQL Server https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads
- And much more...

### Server OS (Where the backend and database run on!)
- Linux Based Servers (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc...) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions
- Windows Server https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/windows-server
- MacOS Server https://www.apple.com/macos/server/
- FreeBSD Server https://www.freebsd.org/

## Git
I don't know too much about branching and merging, but I think it's necessary to prevent accidently overwriting someones code. Here's an article I found how to use Git's branching functionality: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging
