## Some Front End Resources
For front end, a general knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript is useful (no need to memorize every term, use a cheet sheet!)
If you know C++, Java, or Python, Javascript should be very easy to learn as it is simple and forgiving

### Some other things to may want to look at:
- Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/, helps organize html and css elements
- ReactJS https://reactjs.org/, Here is a small project I made with ReactJs if you want to see what the code might look like: https://github.com/AndrewVieira/web-calculator

### Some Resources that we may use:
- w3schools https://www.w3schools.com/, Has tutorials and references for html, css, javascript, and much more. I use this a lot!
- Mozilla Firefox Devloper https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/, Another website that has tutorials and references
- CSS Tricks https://css-tricks.com/, shows you how to do some cool effects and design with CSS
- Google Fonts https://fonts.google.com/
- Paletton https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF, Are you bad at choosing colors like me? This website might help (or not lol)
- Stock Images, Templates, Photos, Music: There are free resources online for these things but be very careful using these because of copyright! Try using original material so we have less to worry about legal wise.

# Backend and Database
- Javascript: NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/, ExpressJS (used with NodeJS) https://expressjs.com/
- PostgreSQL https://www.postgresql.org/

## Git
I don't know too much about branching and merging, but I think it's necessary to prevent accidently overwriting someones code. Here's an article I found how to use Git's branching functionality: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging
