# Online-Music-Library-Database-Project
A place for musicians to post songs, and where listeners can listen to tracks.

## Things to Do
- Research - project topic, tools we might use (frontend, backend, databases), Github and Git, asthetic design
- Requirements - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TJcsjRqCJuuR4YRm3Q-0Q3vTW1bsBURwJpG5dSwuCvI/edit?usp=sharing

## Some Front End Resources
For front end, a general knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript is useful (no need to memorize every term, use a cheet sheet!)
If you know C++, Java, or Python, Javascript should be very easy to learn as it is simple and forgiving

Some other things to may want to look at:
- Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/, helps organize html and css elements
- ReactJS https://reactjs.org/, Here is a small project I made with ReactJs if you want to see what the code might look like: https://github.com/AndrewVieira/web-calculator

Some Resources that we may use:
- w3schools https://www.w3schools.com/, Has tutorials and references for html, css, javascript, and much more. I use this a lot!
- Mozilla Firefox Devloper https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/, Another website that has tutorials and references
- CSS Tricks https://css-tricks.com/, shows you how to do some cool effects and design with CSS
- Google Fonts https://fonts.google.com/
- Paletton https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF, Are you bad at choosing colors like me? This website might help (or not lol)
- Stock Images, Templates, Photos, Music: There are free resources online for these things but be very careful using these because of copyright! Try using original material so we have less to worry about legal wise.

## Some Backend and Databases to Consider
### Backends
- C/C++: (I don't know any, feel free to add suggestions)
- Python: Django https://www.djangoproject.com/, Flask https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/
- Java: (I don't know any, feel free to add suggestions)
- Javascript: NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/

### Databases
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- I don't know much on this topic... Much more research needed
