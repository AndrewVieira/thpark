# Online-Music-Library-Database-Project
A place for musicians to post songs, and where listeners can listen to tracks.

Team Information - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17_FFCro4WTE8n7NICMeMUmBagxfW4iWU0G2M5F5uiqU/edit

## Things to Do
- Research - project topic, tools we might use (frontend, backend, databases), Github and Git, asthetic design
- Requirements - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TJcsjRqCJuuR4YRm3Q-0Q3vTW1bsBURwJpG5dSwuCvI/edit?usp=sharing

## Some Front End Resources
For front end, a general knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript is useful (no need to memorize every term, use a cheet sheet!)
If you know C++, Java, or Python, Javascript should be very easy to learn as it is simple and forgiving

### Some other things to may want to look at:
- Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/, helps organize html and css elements
- ReactJS https://reactjs.org/, Here is a small project I made with ReactJs if you want to see what the code might look like: https://github.com/AndrewVieira/web-calculator

### Some Resources that we may use:
- w3schools https://www.w3schools.com/, Has tutorials and references for html, css, javascript, and much more. I use this a lot!
- Mozilla Firefox Devloper https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/, Another website that has tutorials and references
- CSS Tricks https://css-tricks.com/, shows you how to do some cool effects and design with CSS
- Google Fonts https://fonts.google.com/
- Paletton https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF, Are you bad at choosing colors like me? This website might help (or not lol)
- Stock Images, Templates, Photos, Music: There are free resources online for these things but be very careful using these because of copyright! Try using original material so we have less to worry about legal wise.

## Some Backend and Databases to Consider
### Backends
- C/C++: (I don't know any, feel free to add suggestions)
- Python: Django https://www.djangoproject.com/, Flask https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/
- Java: (I don't know any, feel free to add suggestions)
- Javascript: NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/

### Databases
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- I don't know much on this topic... Much more research needed

### Server OS
If you are doing backend work, you will want to make sure your code and database work with the server os. Linux OSs are the most commonly used os for backend (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc...), but we could still use a different operating system like Windows. A Linux os might be the better choice though because it is free. The OS we choose will be important if we choose C/C++ for backend because some libraries that work in Window for C/C++ may not work in Linux and vice versa. With languages like Python or Java this should be less of a problem.

## Git
I don't know too much about branching and merging, but I think it's necessary to prevent accidently overwriting someones code. Here's an article I found how to use Git's branching functionality: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging
